    }],
    // Your social profile links. The icons of the given social medias are available in the static folder. If you are adding a new item, include the icon in the static/images folder.
    social: [{

        }
    ],
    contact: {
        api_url: "https://getform.io/f/f227a36xxxxxx", // leave empty ('') or false to hide form
        description: `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed sit amet accumsan arcu. Proin ac consequat arcu.`,
        mail: "hi@akzhy.com",
        phone: "000-000-0000",
        address: "1234 \nLocation \nLocation"
    },
}

```

#### Creating new blog posts.

Open the `contents/blog` folder and create a new folder with the name you wish to see as the URL. Inside the folder create an `index.md` file and also include any files you wish to add.

The frontmatter should be of the below structure

```
---
title: Title of your post
date: 2019-06-29 <-- Date should be in the given format
image: ./image.jpg <-- Image shown on the list pages and also used as open graph image
banner: ./banner.jpg <-- Banner shown in the blog post
description: The description shown in the listing page. Also used for SEO description. 
---
```

If you don't want the blog section, simply delete everything inside the `contents/blog` folder. (Do not delete the folder itself)

#### Creating new portfolio posts.

Open the `contents/portfolio` folder and create a new folder with the name you wish to see as the URL. Inside the folder create an `index.md` file and also include any files you wish to add.

The frontmatter should be of the below structure

```
---
title: Title of your post
date: 2019-06-29 <-- Date should be in the given format
banner: ./banner.jpg <-- Banner shown in the portfolio post and also used as open graph image
image: ./image.jpg <-- Image shown on the list pages 
description: The description shown in the listing page. Also used for SEO description. 
---
```

Portfolio pages support the creation of grids.

To create a grid, follow the below structure

```
<Row>
<Col>

**Markdown**

</Col>
</Row>
```

The columns will have equal width on wide screens, and will expand on smaller screens.

#### Creating miscellaneous posts

These posts follow the URL structure of `http://example.com/miscellaneous-post/`. They are useful for creating pages like `privacy-policy`

The "About" page is created as a miscellaneous post.

Open the `contents/basepages` folder and create a new folder with the name you wish to see as the URL. Inside the folder create an `index.md` file and also include any files you wish to add.

The frontmatter should be of the below structure

```
---
title: Title of your post
image: ./image.jpg <-- Image  used as open graph image
description: The description used for SEO. 
---
```

### Contact Form

The contact form will appear only if you have provided an api url. You can control the data sent to the server and can execute callback functions on response from the server.

To customize these functions, edit the `config.js` file.

The `beforeContactFormSubmit` function is used to validate the form data before it is sent to the server. It has one argument that contains the object 

```
{
    name: string,
    email: string,
    message: string
}
```

You can validate the data and return 
```
{
    data: {
        name: data.name,
        email: data.email,
        message: data.message,
    },
    result: true,
}
```
if the data is valid. Otherwise return 

```
errors = [
    {
        code: int, // 1-4
        /* Codes
         Code 1 - Name
         Code 2 - Email
         Code 3 - Message
         Code 4 - Other
        */
        message: string
    }
]
return {
    result: false,
    errors: errors,
}

```

You can also handle how data is sent to the server by editing the `contactFormSubmit` function. It should return the below object to indicate whether the message was sent.
```
{
    result: boolean // true for success, false for fail
}
```
